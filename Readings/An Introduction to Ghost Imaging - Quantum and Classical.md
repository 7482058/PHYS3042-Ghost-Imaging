An introduction to ghost imaging: quantum and classical Miles J. Padgett 1 and Robert W. Boyd1,2,3 
## Questions
- The only reason quantum entangled photons is used is to be able to measure the spatial profile of the beam at the same time as sending it only the object?


## Notes



- Ghost imaging is often thought of as a quantum effect.
	- Initial observation in the 90s involved generating a signal and idler beam via down conversion
	- You would then place an object in the idler path and image with a single photo receptor (i.e. not get any imaging information, only the number of photons passed by the object)
	- You would then measure the spatial profile of the signal beam
		- Only photons that hit both of the sensors can be recorded
	- Since signal and idler beams are identical as they are correlated photons, you can use cross correlation to infer what the object is 
	- The only reason quantum entangled photons is used is to be able to measure the spatial profile of the beam at the same time as sending it only the object?
		- However Quantum ghost imaging is a good way to demonstrate that the emitted photons are in fact entangled due to inversion of image..?
- Benefits of Quantum ghost imaging
	- Using down conversion and phase matching (covered in phys3057...) such that the emitted photons are at different wavelengths allows you to illuminate an object at one wavelength and observe at a different wave length
		- useful depending on sensor characteristics
		- Especially useful if you can use a image sensor array rather than just a single photodetector (which can be done by increasing sensitivity etc)
- Classical ghost imaging
	- Implating a PRN mask onto the beam
		- Split into imaging and signal beam, pass imaging beam onto object
		- Measure signal beam spatial profile
		- Measure imaging beam photon count
		- Apply some autocorrelation algorithm onto the photon count data and spatial profile to infer image information
		- Can also be done to do 3d imaging
- Further things to read
	- Single pixel cameras
	- Compressed sensing
